This code serves as the basis for the website http://www.threetrailstaiko.com.

It is also used a sandbox to learn Razor and StructureMap as well as a way to experiment with SQL and  design patterns such as Data Repositories, Data Models, and abstract implementation via interfaces.

The database connection string is purposefully absent from the web.config, and the resource images have not been included in this repository.
